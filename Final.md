# Introduction and Synopsis of Modules

On the first day of class when Dr. Graham explained the central focus of this course how it would be an experiment of sorts, I was extremely hesitant to stay in the course. It was so unlike any other course I had taken, where the expectations were cleary, had a defined idea of "right" and "wrong" and where failure was not an option that could still appear to be an A. 

Throughout this previous semester we (my partner Kurt and I) explored various aspects of digital history through four modules all to do with a replica of a faience hippopotamus nicknamed "William". The hippopotamus will be referred to as such throughout this first section. 

In the first module we created a 3D model of William using Scann3D and began to explore the intricacies to do with making a 3D model from a replica. I am not sure we would have chosen William had we known how large of an undertaking it was dealing with something twice removed from an original. In this we created an even more imperfect model, with a jagged face, than the plaster replica we already had.

In the second module we attempted to remix our 3D model with one that we pulled from the internet of the Ishtar gate. This was done using Meshmixer. Following a major theme of the course "programming is forgetting," the textures of both William and the Ishtar Gate were lost making them virtually, and literally, unrecognizable. This created problems for what we wanted to talk about in our paradata, which is discussed in greater detail there.

In the third module we created a "Choose Your Own Adventure" type game using Twine. This centred around a fictional narrative about the excavation of William once very little information was found to do with it. So although this module was successful and caused us significantly less technical stress than the previous two, it contingued to reinforce the idea of distorting an object through its digitization.

In the final module we attempted to create an AR model of William with and without his legs. This was done using HP Reveal and the concept for his legs to be connected and then broken off came from research done about how William was orginally found with broken legs. We wanted to show the duplicity in the object, almost as if to bring the beginning of his place in Western tradition to the modern era. Once again, the textures disappeared and made it especially difficult to see William, with or without his legs, rendering this module nothing but an exercise in futility.

In this portfolio I want to explore the key question of this course "What happens to history as it gets digitized?" I will attempt to do this through careful examination of our modules, tying in class discussion and readings to add depth when applicable.

# What happens to history as it gets digitized?

"What happens to history as it gets digitized? That is, what does history look like, what happens to our materials, and the stories we tell or the questions we ask, as we abstract further and further away from ‘In Real Life’? What does ‘digital history’ really mean?"

So to answer the question I believe it should be broken down into three main parts that hopefully lead to answer of what digital history is. The three distinctions I have made come directly from the question: what does history look like? What about the materials? And what about the narratives that are told?

# What does History look like?
In many of my other classes Professors have emphasized that history is as much about the present as it is about the past. Events in the past, especially in the distant past, can only be speculated about. There is only so much that can be understood about an event without living in that time and even then it is still only one perspective. Basically, history can be seen through a series of records and artifacts however there is not one way that history can look. One of the first concepts introduced in the course is that through digital archeology, history can be represented in many ways. Through the introduction of technology archeology has changed and that has necessitated a change in what can be considered a historical object. It no longer has to be an "original" object, it allows for replicas and reconstructions to have the same authority. Which leads me to my first main point about what history looks like; History is always a mutant. 
In every module we were successful at creating something, but we were not successful at creating an exact copy of the object. The best module to exemplify this is module one. From the very beginning, regardless of who did the scanning, how many pictures were taken, and how many different lighting angles were used, William always ended up with a distorted face. That is not an accurate depiction of what our model of William looked like. This continued to be a running theme in our modules. Every time something did not translate digitally, we lost and mutated William in some way. Through the loss of William's and the Ishtar Gate's missing textures, we lost context for why we chose and Egyptian figurine to face a Mesopotamian Gate. In our final module William was so distorted it barely looked like a hippopotamus was used, let alone purposely altered with all the accidental alterations that occured through the digitization process.
