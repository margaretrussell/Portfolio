# Introduction and Synopsis of Modules
Throughout this previous semester we (my partner Kurt and I) explored various aspects of digital history through four modules all to do with a replica of a faience hippopotamus nicknamed "William". The hippopotamus will be referred to as such throughout this first section. 

In the first module we created a 3D model of William using Scann3D and began to explore the intricacies to do with making a 3D model from a replica. I am not sure we would have chosen William had we known how large of an undertaking it was dealing with something twice removed from an original. In this we created an even more imperfect model, with a jagged face, than the plaster replica we already had.

In the second module we attempted to remix our 3D model with one that we pulled from the internet of the Ishtar gate. This was done using Meshmixer. Following a major theme of the course "programming is forgetting," the textures of both William and the Ishtar Gate were lost making them virtually, and literally, unrecognizable. This created problems for what we wanted to talk about in our paradata, which is discussed in greater detail there.

In the third module we created a "Choose Your Own Adventure" type game using Twine. This centred around a fictional narrative about the excavation of William once very little information was found to do with it. So although this module was successful and caused us significantly less technical stress than the previous two, it contingued to reinforce the idea of distorting an object through its digitization.

In the final module we attempted to create an AR model of William with and without his legs. This was done using HP Reveal and the concept for his legs to be connected and then broken off came from research done about how William was orginally found with broken legs. We wanted to show the duplicity in the object, almost as if to bring the beginning of his place in Western tradition to the modern era. Once again, the textures disappeared and made it especially difficult to see William, with or without his legs, rendering this module nothing but an exercise in futility.

In this portfolio I want to explore the key question of this course "What happens to history as it gets digitized?" I will attempt to do this through careful examination of our modules, tying in class discussion and readings to add depth when applicable.

# What happens to history as it gets digitized?

"What happens to history as it gets digitized? That is, what does history look like, what happens to our materials, and the stories we tell or the questions we ask, as we abstract further and further away from ‘In Real Life’? What does ‘digital history’ really mean?"

On the first day of class when Dr. Graham explained the central focus of this course how it
